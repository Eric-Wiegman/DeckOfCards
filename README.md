The DeckOfCards app is a game that tests the "Deck of Cards" API by creating a new deck of cards; adding jokers; shuffling it; and then iteratively asking the user to draw a number of cards.

## Features
- Implements automation to test the following APIs in Java
  - Create a new deck of cards
    - GET https://deckofcardsapi.com/api/deck/new/
  - Support adding Jokers with a POST
  - Draw one or more cards from a deck
     - GET https://deckofcardsapi.com/api/deck/<>/draw/
- Takes advantage of Object Oriented principles and code organization. 

## Getting started
Prerequisites:
- Your computer should be running the latest Windows 10, version 1809 or newer. It is not required, but the code was developed and tested on that environment.
- Install the latest version of your favorite IDE -- such as Eclipse or IntelliJ.
- Install the needed JDK code in able to run the Java code.
- Get the code:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Eric-Wiegman/DeckOfCard.git
    ```

- Open the CardsTester.java file and run it as a Java Application to play the game that indirectly tests the API.
- Open the APITests.java file and run it as a TestNG Test to run QA Test Cases to more formally test the API.
